Sudoku solution points

A good name for the methods:
	complete row
	complete column
	complete square
	exclude numbers
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	working with cells
	what I need:
		exclude given value from a given 
			square
			row
			column
			=> mentioned above is done after every retrieval of a new value for a particular cell, is it's needed anyway
		
		
	
	square index of row (squareNum) = squareNum - squareNum %3
	f(x)   index   row number
	f(1) = 0       1
	f(2) = 0       1
	f(3) = 0       1
	f(4) = 3       4  
	f(5) = 3       4 
	f(6) = 3       4  
	f(7) = 6       7
	f(8) = 6       7
	f(9) = 6       7
	
	3*Math.floor((x-1)/3)
